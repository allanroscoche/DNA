abstract = {New sequencing technology has dramatically altered the landscape of whole-genome sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms. The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.},

abstract = {We have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "Velvet," to manipulate de Bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

DNA sequencing data from the Roche 454, Illumina/Solexa, and ABI SOLiD platforms typically present shorter read lengths, higher coverage, and different error profiles compared with Sanger sequencing data. Since 2005, several assembly software packages have been created or revised specifically for de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing data. This review summarizes and compares the published descriptions of packages named SSAKE, SHARCGS, VCAKE, Newbler, Celera Assembler, Euler, Velvet, ABySS, AllPaths, and SOAPdenovo. More generally, it compares the two standard methods known as the de Bruijn graph approach and the overlap/layout/consensus approach to assembly.},

@article{Nijkamp2012,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparing genomes of individual organisms using next generation sequencing data is, until now, mostly performed using a reference genome. This is challenging when the reference is distant and introduces bias towards the exact sequence present in the reference. Recent improvements in both sequencing read length and efficiency of assembly algorithms have brought direct comparison of individual genomes by de novo assembly, rather than via a reference genome, within reach. RESULTS: Here, we develop and test an algorithm, named Magnolya, which employs a Poisson mixture model for copy number estimation of contigs assembled from sequencing data. We combine this with co-assembly to allow de novo detection of copy number variation between two individual genomes, without mapping reads to a reference genome. In co-assembly, multiple sequencing samples are combined, generating a single contig graph with different traversal counts for the nodes and edges between the samples. In the resulting "colored" graph the contigs have integer copy-numbers; this negates the need to segment genomic regions based on depth of coverage, as required for mapping-based detection methods. Magnolya is then used to assign integer copy numbers to contigs, after which copy number variation probabilities are easily inferred.The copy number estimator and copy number variation detector perform well on simulated data. Application of the algorithms to hybrid yeast genomes showed allotriploid content from different origin in the wine yeast Y12, and extensive copy number variation in aneuploid brewing yeast genomes. Integer copy number variation was also accurately detected in a short-term laboratory evolved yeast strain. AVAILABILITY: Magnolya is implemented in Python and available at: http://bioinformatics.tudelft.nl/ CONTACT: d.deridder@tudelft.nl.},
